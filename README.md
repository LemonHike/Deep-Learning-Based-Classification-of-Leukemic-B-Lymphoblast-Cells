# Thesis
This repository contains the notebooked used to classify Leukemic B-Lymphoblasts from B-Lympoid Precursor cells.

The repository contains three different notebooks: 
1) Cropping Notebook
2) Model Trained From Scratch
3) Transfer Learning

## Cropping Notebook
This notebook contains the code used to crop the cell image around their edges. 

## Model Trained From Scratch
This notebook contains the code used to implement the architecture described in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.3. : Developing an architecture. 

## Tranfer Learning
This notebook contains the codes used to fine-tune ResNet and DenseNet as described in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.2. : Transfer Learning


The final results show how a simple convolutional neural network, with three convolution layers and one fully connected layer, can classify malignant B-Lymphoblasts from early benign B cell precursors with 82.5% accuracy, 87% precision and 96% specificity.
Note: a PDF containing a ditailed discussion of the methodologies and the results will be updated soon.
